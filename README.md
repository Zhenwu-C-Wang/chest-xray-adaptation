# chest-xray-adaptation
This project develops a deep learning model for cross-site generalization and calibration in chest X-ray triage. It aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy across different devices and reduce critical image waiting times, with code for domain adaptation, calibration, and external validation using datasets like NIH ChestX-ray14 and CheXpert.
